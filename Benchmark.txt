Wow. With no optimization or buffering,
and loading every pair of samples individually into a table
(which seems like it'd be inefficient and dumb),
the LuaJIT version is faster than the C version!

And except for small rounding differences, the output files
are identical. Redirecting the Lua version to lua_out.f32 and
the C version to c_out.f32:

$ pmix 'cat lua_out.f32' 'amp -vol -1 <c_out.f32' | replaygain -fB32
+64.54 dB
0.00000006
$ rattodb .00000006
-144.436975

So the max amplitude difference between the two is less than FS-144dB.
For all practical purposes it's absolutely identical.
Differences are due to the Lua version using doubles instead of
32-bit floats, so it's potentially more accurate.
